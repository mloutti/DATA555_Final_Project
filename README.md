# DATA 555 Final Project

## Project Purpose:
This project analyzed attendance trends of fathers in a parenting program designed to improve early childhood development outcomes in Mwanza, Tanzania. This project aimed to answer the following questions:
1. What factors predict (or are associated with) fathersâ€™ attendance at early childhood development educational sessions?
2. How did father attendance rates change over time in different communities?

## Dataset Description:
The data presented in this dashboard are confidential, as related publications are still in development. The data was collected from 
June to November 2024 from 62 fathers participating in a parenting program across six communities in Mwanza, Tanzania. Data sources 
include a baseline survey capturing sociodemographic information and attendance forms documenting father participation at each 
educational session (15 sessions total).

## Real-World Impact:
This dashboard will be used to help inform the development of a future parenting program in Mwanza, Tanzania. Additionally, it is 
helpful in showing that the type of job fathers work and their baseline interest level in the program did not significantly impact 
their attendance at sessions, guiding future research.
